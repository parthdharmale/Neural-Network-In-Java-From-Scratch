# How to Run
- Open the App2.java file and then first compile it and then run it.

# Difference Between App.java and App2.java
- The `App.java` is a static code which has only `6` neurons spread across three layers and fixed number of epochs.
- The `App2.java` has user inputted number of layers, `numLayers*(numLayers + 1)/2` number of neurons and user inputted epochs. You can run both the codes and see the difference between the losses. The loss is significantly less in App2.java
